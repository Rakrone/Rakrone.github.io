                        What are the origins of life on Earth? How did things go from non-living to living, from something that could not reproduce to something that could? How can a collection of inanimate atoms become animate? How did organic molecules achieve a high enough level of complexity to be considered as &ldquo;living&ldquo;? The short answer is: we do not really know how life originated on this planet. The longer answer, however, is much more interesting.

                        The study of the origin of life on Earth or, more specifically, how life on Earth began from inanimate matter, is technically known as abiogenesis (as opposed to biogenesis, which is the process of lifeforms producing other lifeforms, and as opposed to evolution, which is the study of how living things have changed over time since life first arose).

                        The modern definition of abiogenesis, however, is concerned with the formation of the simplest forms of life from primordial chemicals, rather than the old Aristotelian concept of abiogenesis, which postulated the formation of fully-formed complex organisms by spontaneous generation. It becomes, then, the search for some kind of molecule (along the lines of RNA or DNA) that is simple enough that it can be made by physical processes on the young Earth, yet complicated enough that it can take charge of making more of itself, which is probably what most people would recognize as constituting &ldquo;life&ldquo;.</p>
